# Reducing_Commercial_Aviation_Fatalities

## Description

This was our project for the Foundations  of Data Analytics class wherein we are provided with real physiological data from pilots who were subjected to various distracting events. The pilots experienced distractions and resulted in one of the following three cognitive states:

• Channelized Attention (CA): This occurs when the pilot is focusing only on one task without giving any attention to other tasks.

• Diverted Attention (DA): The state of having one’s attention diverted by actions or thought processes associated with a decision. This is induced by having the subjects perform a display monitoring task.

• Startle/Surprise (SS): This is the response to a sudden unexpected stimulus. In aviation, this can be defined as an uncontrollable automatic reflex or reaction caused due to exposure to a sudden intense event that violated a pilot’s expectations.

The aim is to build a model that can estimate the state of mind of the pilot in real-time using the physiological data given. When the pilot enters into any one of the above mentioned dangerous cognitive states, he/she should be alerted, thereby preventing any possible accident.

## Tech stack used

Python : as the primary programming language

Jupyter Notebook : as the platform to run individual sections of the code

Various ML libraries in python : To visualise,preprocess and build models on the dataset.
